    <em><h4><p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that my skills and experiences put me ahead of others. First, I have good
        communication skills. I can build strong relationships with others. I can share my thoughts and
        messages without any confusion. Additionally, I participated in many group projects and
        workshops as a leader and as an active member. I have a passion for organizing different things.
        My friends always rely on me to assign them different tasks. The groups I led prepared the best
        projects among all of them. Moreover, I have the potential to balance and control my tasks,
        emotions, and daily life. I use my time wisely and make a schedule for all of my daily tasks.</p></h4></em>

        <em><h4><p style="text-align: justify;">Pursuing an undergraduate degree is my natural next step. I want to gain as numerous
            achievements and experiences as I can because this is the best time to know your career. To
            begin with, during my undergraduate degree, I will take several courses in business
            administration. These courses can provide a better understanding of finance, accounting,
            marketing, and other factors in business administration. In addition, while running my
            undergraduate degree, I want to work as a volunteer in some organizations, which is useful for
            an undergraduate student.</p></h4></em>
